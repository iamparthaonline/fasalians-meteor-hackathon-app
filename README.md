# Team Fasalians - Meteor Hackathon 2022

We are Team Fasalians from India. In this hackathon we are going to build a very interesting application to
connect agri lovers, agriculturists, farmers and everyone associated with agri business from around the world.

Where all the like minded people can discuss and share their ideas on the field of agriculture,
get necessary information/contents related to agri industry and more importantly get help in their journey of building a sustainable world.
